## 📰 Title Optimization

### Best Practices
✅ **DO:**
- Keep between 40-60 characters (including spaces)
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Make it compelling and click-worthy
- Use numbers when relevant (e.g., "5 Ways to...")
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use title case capitalization

❌ **DON'T:**
- Exceed 70 characters (gets cut off in search results)
- Use clickbait or misleading titles
- Stuff with too many keywords
- Use all caps or excessive punctuation
- Be vague or generic

### Good Examples
- ✅ "Building a Real-Time Object Detection System with YOLOv8"
- ✅ "5 Advanced PyTorch Techniques for Faster Training"
- ✅ "How I Reduced Model Inference Time by 70%"

### Poor Examples
- ❌ "My Project" (too vague)
- ❌ "AMAZING BREAKTHROUGH IN AI THAT WILL SHOCK YOU!!!" (clickbait)
- ❌ "Machine Learning Deep Learning AI Neural Networks Tutorial Guide" (keyword stuffing)
- ❌ "This is an extremely long title that goes on and on and gets cut off in search results which is bad" (too long)

---

## 📝 Description/Excerpt Guidelines

- End with a call to action if appropriate
- Write unique descriptions for each article

❌ **DON'T:**
- Copy the first sentence of the article
- Exceed 160 characters (gets truncated)

- ✅ "A practical guide to applying deep learning for time series forecasting. Covers LSTMs, Transformers, and best practices." (122 chars)

### Poor Examples
- ❌ "This article is about machine learning." (too short, 41 chars)
- ❌ "In this article, I'm going to talk about..." (boring opening)
- ❌ "Machine learning deep learning AI neural networks PyTorch TensorFlow optimization training inference deployment production..." (keyword stuffing, 128 chars)

---

## 🔗 Slug (URL) Best Practices

### Guidelines
- Use lowercase only
- Separate words with hyphens (-)

- Remove stop words when possible (the, a, an, of, etc.)
- Match the article title (simplified)

### Good Examples
- ✅ `realtime-object-detection-yolov8`
- ✅ `pytorch-training-optimization-tips`
- ✅ `reduce-model-inference-time`
- ✅ `deep-learning-time-series-guide`

### Poor Examples
- ❌ `My_Article_123` (inconsistent, unclear)
- ❌ `building-a-real-time-object-detection-system-with-yolov8-complete-guide` (too long)
- ❌ `article-2024-11-02` (no keywords)
- ❌ `ML Tutorial!` (uppercase, special chars, space)

---

## 🏷️ Tags & Keywords

### Choosing Tags
- Use 3-7 tags per article

## ✍️ Article Content Best Practices

### Structure
1. **Introduction** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Hook the reader
   - State what they'll learn
   - Include primary keyword

2. **Body** (Main content)
   - Use H2 and H3 headings
   - Break into scannable sections
   - Include code examples
   - Add images/diagrams
   - Use bullet points and lists

3. **Conclusion** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Summarize key points
   - Include call to action
   - Link to related articles

### Heading Hierarchy
```
# Article Title (H1 - automatically from title field)

## Main Section (H2)
Introduction to the topic...

### Subsection (H3)
Detailed explanation...

## Another Main Section (H2)
More content...

### Another Subsection (H3)
Additional details...
```

### Content Length
- **Minimum**: 800-1000 words
- **Optimal**: 1500-2500 words

## 🔗 Internal Linking Strategy

### Within Articles
- Link to related articles when relevant
- Link to portfolio projects
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Open external links in new tab (optional)

### Good Link Examples
